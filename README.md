# Analyzing-mobile-app-data
Analyzing the data set of a company that builds android and ios mobile apps and make them available on Google Play and in the App Store.
This company only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of their apps determines their revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.
The goal for this project is to analyze data to help their developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

This project was done using jupyter notebook
